# MCP-Based Multi-Agent AI System for Drug Development Intelligence

## Overview

This project aims to develop a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**–enabled multi-agent AI system designed to **gather, normalize, and summarize drug development information** across diverse biomedical data sources. The system is built for **EMD Serono’s Competitive Intelligence (CI)** workflows to accelerate evidence-based decision-making and improve visibility across all four clinical trial phases.

## Objectives

* **Aggregate and standardize** data from literature, patents, chemical databases, regulatory filings, and scientific news.
* **Leverage multi-agent collaboration** for automated retrieval, synthesis, and summarization of drug development information.
* **Integrate MCP servers** to enable interoperability between models, data pipelines, and tool providers.
* **Develop an observability layer** that ensures auditability, transparency, and compliance in all agent actions.
